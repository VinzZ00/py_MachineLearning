# py_MachineLearning

Here I create a machine learning using dataset from Milliams about years weather,
I pre-process the Null data using pandas and numpy library and then I use the Scikit RandomForestClassifier to make a machine learning by using 75% of the data to become the trainer and 25% for the tester
the accuracy of the model is about 89.xx% by using the RandomForestClassifier. I think I will be higher if I use the linear Regression. I will make one with scikit.linear_model library.
Thankyou For reading this :)
